title: "FTZ: A State-Inferring Fuzzer for the TCP/IP Stack of Zephyr"
---

For my master's thesis, I wrote a state-inferring structure-aware coverage and state guided fuzzer for the TCP/IP stack of the open-source real-time operating system Zephyr based on LibAFL.

You can find the source code of the fuzzer on [GitHub](https://github.com/riesentoaster/FTZ), and the thesis [here](https://github.com/riesentoaster/FTZ/releases/download/v1.0/FTZ.A.State-Inferring.Fuzzer.for.the.TCP.IP.Stack.of.Zephyr.pdf).
